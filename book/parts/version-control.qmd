title: Version Control
---

Version control is a tool that helps us create snapshots of our work over time.
In data science, this helps keep our data science project clean and tidy without
temporary files we hope to keep for reference or "afraid to lose".

Online version control services make it easier for us to collaborate with other people
and do project management tasks.
