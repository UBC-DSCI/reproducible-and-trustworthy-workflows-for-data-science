1. Write a container file (e.g., Dockerfile) that can be used to reproducibly build a
container image that would contain the needed software and environment
dependencies of your Data Science project
2. Use manual and automated tools (e.g., Docker, GitHub Actions) to build and share
container images
3. List good container base images for Data Science projects
