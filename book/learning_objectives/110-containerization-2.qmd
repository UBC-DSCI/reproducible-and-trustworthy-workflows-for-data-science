1. Use the containerization software (e.g., Docker command line and Docker compose) to run the software needed for your
analysis
2. Use port mapping with the containerization software to run web apps to access IDEs (e.g., Jupyter, RStudio, VSCode)
3. Use volume mounting with the containerization software to allow the container access to local host files (e.g., analysis code and data files)
