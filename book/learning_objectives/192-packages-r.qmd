1. Be able to distinguish between essential software package elements (required to make a minimal software package)
   and those that are not essential but act to improve the user and developer experiences.
2. Define what a namespace is.
3. Explain the role of the code within the following software package files:
  - R
    - `DESCRIPTION`
    - `NAMESPACE`
    - `man/*.Rd`

5. Compare and contrast how the Cookiecutter project template tool sets up a software package structure to how `devtools` and `usethis` set up a software package.
6. Generate well formatted function and package-level documentation for software packages using available tools (e.g., `Roxygen2` and `pkgdown` in R)
