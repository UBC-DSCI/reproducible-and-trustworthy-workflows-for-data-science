1. Explain when it is optimal to work in a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) framework and
when it is optimal to shift to using non-interactive scripts.
2. Be able to create simple scripts in R that can take input and be executed
from the command line.
3. Decide when to move from using command line arguments to pass variables into a
