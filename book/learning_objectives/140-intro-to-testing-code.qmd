1. Fully specify a function and write comprehensive tests against the specification.
2. Reproducibly generate test data (e.g., data frames, models, plots).
3. Discuss the observability of unit outputs in data science (e.g., plot objects), and how
this should be taken into account when designing software.
4. Explain why test-driven development (TDD) affords testability
5. Use exceptions when writing code.
6. Test if a function is throwing an exception when it should, and that is does not do so
when it shouldnâ€™t.
7. Evaluate test suite quality.
