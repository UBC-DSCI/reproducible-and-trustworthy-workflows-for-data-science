## Calculating coverage in R

We use the [`covr`](https://covr.r-lib.org/) R package to do this.

Install via R console:

```r
install.packages("covr")
```

To calculate line coverage and have it show in the viewer pane in RStudio:

```r
covr::report()
```

Currently `covr` does not have the functionality to calculate branch coverage. Thus this is up to you in R to calculate this by hand if you really want to know.

> Why has this not been implemented? It has been in an now unsupported package (see [here](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/testCoverage)), but its implementation was too complicated for others to understand. Automating the calculation of branch coverage is non-trivial, and this is a perfect demonstration of that.
