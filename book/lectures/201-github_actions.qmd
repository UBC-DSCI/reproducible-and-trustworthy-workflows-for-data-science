## GitHub actions

A tool and service for automating software development tasks, located in the same place where you already store your code.

### Key concepts:
**Actions:** Individual tasks you want to perform.

**Workflow:** A collection of actions (specified together in one file).

**Event:** Something that triggers the running of a workflow.

**Runner**: A machine that can run the Github Action(s).

**Job**: A set of steps executed on the same runner.

**Step**: A set of commands or actions which a job executes.

### Examples of GitHub Actions

You have already interacted with GitHub Actions in this class! We used it to:

1. Generate the issues in the [`dsci-310-homework` repo](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-homework) upon push to the "create" branch: <https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-homework/blob/master/.github/workflows/create_issues.yml>

2. Generate a pull request in the [`review-my-pull-request` repo](https://github.com/ttimbers/review-my-pull-request) upon push to the "pr" branch: : <https://github.com/ttimbers/review-my-pull-request/blob/master/.github/workflows/pr.yml>

Getting to know GitHub Actions workflows

We are going to each create our own GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow is a very simple toy example where we run some `echo` shell commands to print things to the runner's terminal.

#### Steps:

1. Create a new public **GitHub.com** repository with a `README`.

2. Click on the "Actions" tab

3. Click on the first "Set up this workflow" button

4. Click on the two green commit buttons to add this workflow file

5. Go to the "Actions" tab and look at the build logs by following these instructions:

    Click on the message associated with the event that created the action:

    <img src="../img/check-logs1.png" width=600>

    Click on the build link:

    <img src="../img/check-logs2.png" width=600>

    Click on the arrow inside the build logs to expand a section and see the output of the action:

### GitHub Actions workflow file:

A `YAML` file that lives in the `.github/workflows` directory or your repository which species your workflow.

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.

```

The file above has:

- 3 possible event triggers (push to main, pull request to main, or manual dispatch through the Actions tab)
- runs on an Ubuntu OS
- one job called "build"
- 3 steps
- the type of runner is ubuntu
- the first step uses an action, and the following two steps run commands

### Commands vs actions

Steps can consist commands or actions. Let's spend some time to discuss what each of these are and how they differ.

### Commands

Steps that use commands look like the one shown below. They consist of a `name` and a `run` parameter. The commands listed after `run` are run in the runner's shell:

```yaml
- name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
```

As shown in the file above, we can run multiple commands in a step using the `|` character:

```yaml
- name: Run a multi-line script
      run: |
        echo Add other actions to build,
        echo test, and deploy your project.
```

### Actions

Steps that use actions look like the one shown below (which builds and publishes Docker containers). They always have a `uses` parameter, and often also have `name` and `with` parameters. The `uses` parameter specifies which action to use, and the `with` parameters provide arguments to those actions. The `@master` at the name of the `uses` line, specifies whether to use the version at the head of the actions default branch, or a specific version (*e.g.,* `@v2`).

```yaml
- name: Publish to Registry
      uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5
      with:
        name: myDocker/repository
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
```

Actions commonly perform one task in a workflow. There are two ways to build actions, either using JavaScript or by creating a Docker container that runs a shell script. For the latter such actions are defined by:

- a Dockerfile
- a shell script to run inside the Docker container

:::{.callout-note}
In this course we will use actions built by others, but not build our own. That is beyond the scope of this course. However, if you are interested in learning more, I point you to the documentation below.

#### Optional:

For example, for the action above see its:
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action/blob/master/Dockerfile)
- [endpoint.sh script](https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action/blob/master/entrypoint.sh)
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action)

## Storing and use GitHub Actions credentials safely via GitHub Secrets

Some of the tasks we want to do in our workflows require authentication. However, the whole point of this is to automate this process - so how can we do that without sharing our authentication tokens, usernames or passwords in our workflow files?

GitHub Secrets is the solution to this!

GitHub Secrets are encrypted environment variables that are used only with GitHub Actions, and specified on a repository-by-repository basis. They can be accessed in a workflow file via: `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

See GitHub's help docs for how to do this: <https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets>

## Authenticating with the `GITHUB_TOKEN`

What if you need to do Git/GitHub things in your workflow? Like checkout your files to run the tests? Create a release? Open an issue? To help with this GitHub automatically (i.e., you do not need to create this secret) creates a secret named `GITHUB_TOKEN` that you can access and use in your workflow. You access this token in your workflow file via:

```yaml
${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Creating and accessing environment variables in GitHub Actions

Sometimes our commands or actions need environment variables. In both of these scenarios, we create environment variables and access them within a step via:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Hello env vars
    run: echo $VARIABLE_NAME1 $VARIABLE_NAME2
    env:
      VARIABLE_NAME1: <variable_value1>
      VARIABLE_NAME2: <variable_value2>
```
