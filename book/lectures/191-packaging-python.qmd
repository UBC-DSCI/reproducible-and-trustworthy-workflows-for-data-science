### Essential Python package files

Using the project layout we recommend for this course,
here is a Python package structure with only the most essential files.

```
pkg
├── pyproject.toml
└── src
    └── pkg
        ├── __init__.py
        └── module.py
```

What do each of these do?

- `pyproject.toml` stores all the metadata and install instructions for the package.

- The presence of the `src` directory defines the code that will form the installable version of your package (meaning that users only get this code when they install the package, and that developers must install the package before running their tests).

- `__init__.py` tells Python that a directory is a package. They can be left empty, or they can also be used to add objects to the package’s namespace, provide documentation, and/or run other initialization code.

- `module.py` (this one can be named something else!) contains the functions you would like to share with your package users.

#### Getting to know a `pyproject.toml` file's contents

Here is an example `pyproject.toml` file:

```
[tool.poetry]                                          ┐
name = "pycounts_tt_2024"                              │
version = "0.1.0"                                      │ Package metadata
description = "Calculate word counts in a text file!"  │
authors = ["Tiffany Timbers"]                          │
license = "MIT"                                        │
readme = "README.md"                                   ┘

[tool.poetry.dependencies]                             ┐
python = ">=3.9"                                       │ User function dependencies
matplotlib = ">=3.8.2"                                 ┘

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]                         ┐
                                                       │
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]                   │
pytest = ">=7.4.4"                                     │
pytest-cov = ">=4.1.0"                                 │ Developer dependencies
jupyter = ">=1.0.0"                                    │
myst-nb = {version = "^1.0.0", python = "^3.9"}        │
sphinx-autoapi = "^3.0.0"                              │
sphinx-rtd-theme = "^2.0.0"                            ┘

[build-system]                                         ┐
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]                      │ Package build dependencies
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"              ┘
```

Almost everything inside this file is customizable based on your package. Even the build system!
`pyproject.toml` can also be used with other build tools such as setuptools and flit!

#### Getting to know a `__init__.py` file's contents

As mentioned earlier, this file can serve it's essential package function of telling Python that this directory is a package by just existing and being empty. It can however serve other purposes. Let's discuss the code that exists in the `py-pkgs-cookiecutter` template:

The `py-pkgs-cookiecutter` we used to create our `pycounts` package ([Section 3.2.2](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#creating-a-package-structure)) already populated our `__init__.py` file with this code for us:

```
# read version from installed package
from importlib.metadata import version
__version__ = version("pycounts")
```

Because this code is in `__init__.py` is executed when the package is imported (this is the case for all `__init__.py` files, we can ask for the package version with Python code like this:

```
import pycounts
pycounts.__version__
```

```
0.1.0
```

In the code in `__init__.py` we get the version from the package metadata, that is derived from `pyproject.toml`. This allows us to only have to update the version of our package in one place when we bump to a new version.

What other kinds of interesting things can we do with `__init__.py`? Well we can use it to control the import behavior of a package. For example, there are currently only two main functions that users will commonly use from our `pycounts` package: `pycounts.count_words()` and `plotting.plot_words()`. Users have to type the full path to these functions to import them:

```
from pycounts.pycounts import count_words
from pycounts.plotting import plot_words
```

If we import those core functions in `pycounts`’s `__init__.py` file, which would bind them to the package namespace, we can make our user's experience of loading them easier!

```
# read version from installed package
from importlib.metadata import version
__version__ = version(__name__)

# populate package namespace
from pycounts.pycounts import count_words
from pycounts.plotting import plot_words
```

The functions are now bound to the pycounts namespace, so users can access them like this:

```
import pycounts
pycounts.count_words
```

```
<function count_words>

```

What is a namespace again? A “namespace” is a set of names that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace)).

### `docs/*` and `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

We will cover both these topics in greater detail later (`docs/*` in the documentation chapter/lecture and `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` in the continuous integration and deployment chapter/lecture), but for now it's helpful to get a bit better of an idea of these files and what they are doing.

#### `docs/*`

To keep things organized, to and to make the package documentation easier to automate, we keep the documentation files in the `docs` directory and use a `Makefile` (or `make.bat` on Windows) therein to automate their rendering.

```
docs
   ├── changelog.md
   ├── conduct.md
   ├── conf.py
   ├── contributing.md
   ├── example.ipynb
   ├── index.md
   ├── make.bat
   └── requirements.txt (deprecated)
```

Note that many of these files also commonly exist in the root of projects and people expect to find them there!!! These include:

- changelog.md
- conduct.md
- contributing.md

So what we have done is pointed the `doc/*.md`'s of these files to the contents these files in the project root. And at rendering, their content will be used instead! If you look at the raw source of one of these files (e.g., conduct.md) you will see:

<img src="../img/python-docs-md-content.png" width=500>

This helps keep our docs up to date by not having two places to update them!

`conf.py` is a configuration file that specifies style and formatting for the documentation. In this course we will not be modifying it, but if you wanted you can! To do this, please first read the docs for [Sphinx configuration here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html).

The `requirements.txt` file in the `pypkgs-cookiecutter` template is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. All dependencies are now managed by `pyproject.toml`.

#### `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

This file contains automation code for continuous integration and delivery of our Python software package, reading the steps in this file you will see that it does the following:

1. Continuous integration tasks:
  - installs your package
  - runs the test suite
  - calculates test coverage
2. Continous deployment tasks:
  - bumps the package software version, as well as prepares and creates a GitHub release of the package
  - builds the package
  - publishes it to the package repository (i.e., TestPyPI or PyPI, or both)

When we first start building our packages, the GitHub Actions workflows for most of these things will fail. That is to be expected! As you complete the tasks for setting each of these up (e.g., writing tests and package code, setting up authentication to PyPI using GitHub secrets, etc) then the GitHub Actions workflows should start passing.
This is a consequence of the philosophy of the `pypkgs-cookiecutter` template tool.

### Essential R package files

Using the project layout we recommend for this course,
here is a R package structure with only the most essential files.

```
pkg
├── DESCRIPTION
├── man
│   ├── functionA.Rd
│   └── functionB.Rd
├── NAMESPACE
└── R
    └── functions.R
```

What do each of these do?

- `DESCRIPTION` stores all the metadata and dependency installation instructions for the package.

- The `man` directory contains the function documentation in `.Rd` files (one per function). The contents are from these are generated from the `ROxygen2` function documentation in the `R/*.R` files.

- Unsurprisingly, the `NAMESPACE` file is important in defining your package’s namespace.

- `R` is the directory for the `*.R` files which contain your exported (i.e., user-facing) functions.

- `functions.R` (this one can be named something else!) contains the functions you would like to share with your package users.

#### Getting to know a `DESCRIPTION` file's contents

Here is an example `DESCRIPTION` file:

```

```

This is equivalent to the `pyproject.toml` file in Python packages. Again, almost everything in it is customizable based on your package's specifics.

#### `man/*Rd` files

The `man` directory contains the function documentation in `.Rd` files (one per function). These can be created from the function's `roxygen2` documentation using `devtools::document`. They use a custom syntax that is loosely based on LaTeX, which can be rendered to different formats for sharing with the package users.

For example, this `roxygen2` documention in `R/fbind.R`:

```
#' Bind two factors
#'
#' Create a new factor from two existing factors, where the new factor's levels
#' are the union of the levels of the input factors.
#'
#' @param a factor
#' @param b factor
#'
#' @return factor
#' @export
#' @examples
#' fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
```

gives this syntax (loosely based on LaTeX) in `man/bind.Rd`:

```latex
% Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
% Please edit documentation in R/fcount.R
\name{fcount}
\alias{fcount}
\title{Make a sorted frequency table for a factor}
\usage{
fcount(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{factor}
}
\value{
A tibble
}
\description{
Make a sorted frequency table for a factor
}
\examples{
fcount(iris$Species)
}
```

#### `NAMESPACE` file

In it are commands applied to R objects. Common commands include indicating that a function should be exported from your package, and/or that a another package should be imported to be used internally. The contents of this file are best to be created automatically using `devtools` to pull this information from the package function's `roxygen2` documentation (exports) and the `DESCRIPTION` file (imports).

Here's an example `NAMESPACE` file:

```
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand

export(compare)
export(expect_equal)
import(rlang)
importFrom(brio,readLines)
```

### Cookiecutter project templates

[`Cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) is a general Python tool for repeatedly generating a desired file and directory structure.

Many many many Python [`Cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) templates already exist, this search on GitHub (linked to from the [`Cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) documentation) identifies 9000 repositories!!!

- <https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&amp%3Btype=Repositories&type=repositories>

How does it work? It uses the concept of code templating and uses the [`Jinja`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) templating engine.
Special syntax (involving `{{`) is used to specify parts of the code that should be
"filled in" with user input (from a function call if interacting directly with the `Jinja`
API, or the keyboard if using `Cookiecutter`).
The input is then used to replace the placeholder text in the code
(denoted by the special syntax involving `{{`).
This allows template code to be automatically filled in and reused again and again!

### Exercise:

Let's explore the `pypkgs-cookiecutter` to get to know how the Cookiecutter project template tool works in the case of `pypkgs-cookiecutter`, and in general!

- Go to: <https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter>
- Looks at: <https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter/blob/main/cookiecutter.json>
- Look for all the places you see `{{ cookiecutter.__SOMETHING }}`

### Differences in package building tool philosophy

#### iClicker question:

Setting the programming language differences aside (and the technical issues with the `pypkgs-Cookiecutter` at the beginning of last week), which approach to package building did you prefer?

A. Adding package components step-by-step as needed, like you did when using `devtools`/`usethis` to create an R package.

B. Setting up the project template in one fell swoop (i.e., once at the beginning of the project), like you did when using `pypkgs-Cookiecutter` to create an R package.

#### In class disucssion

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the `devtools`/`usethis` software package building approach in R?

  - Advantages:
    - Not overwhelming for beginners, since you just add one thing at a time.
    - Allows you to redo the one thing you made a mistake on.

  - Disadvantages:
    - Easy to forget to add or do somethings, as you need to run a different command each time.
    - Somewhat inefficient as a command needs to be run each time you want to add a new feature to the package.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the `pypkgs-Cookiecutter` software package building approach in Python?

  - Advantages:
    - Minimizes forgetting to dd or do somethings, because you just have one setup step at the beginning.
    - Efficient because you just have one setup step at the beginning.

  - Disadvantages:
    - Can be overwhelming for beginners, since you generate a large number of files at one time.
    - Takes a lot of time to when you make a mistake (e.g., typo in package name) because you need to manually got back and fix things.
    - Sets everything up at the beginning, including the things you are not yet ready for (e.g., Continuous integration and deployment workflows on GitHub actions) and there are some annoying consequences of this (e.g., notifications about failed checks).

## Dealing with other package dependencies in your package

### Dealing with package dependencies in R

- When we write code in our package that uses functions from other packages we need to import those functions from the namespace of their packages.

- In R, we do this via `use_package`, which adds that package to the “Imports” section of DESCRIPTION

- We also need to refer to that package in our function code, there are two ways to do this:
  1. refer the function by `package::fun_name` (e.g., `dplyer::filter`) whenever you use the function in your code
  2. add the function to your packages namespace so that you can just refer to it as your normally would. To do this add `@importFrom <package_name> <function_or_operator>` to the Roxygen documentation of the function that you would like to use the function from the other package in and then use `document()` to update the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE file.

*It is recommended to use method 1 (`pkg::fun_name`) because it is more explicit on what external functions your package code depends on (making it easier to read for collaborators, including future you). The trade off is that it’s a little more work to write.*

### The pipe, `%>%`, a special dependency

- Given the ubiquity of the pipe operator, `%>%`, in R, there is a function that automates exposing to your entire package: `usethis::use_pipe()`

- Note, in general, the tidyverse team does not recommend using the pipe in packages unless they are personal, low use packages, or “pro” packages with a lot of data wrangling because:
  - In most cases it is really an unnecessary dependency
  - It is not that readable for folks who do not typically use the pipe
  - makes debugging more challenging

So, should you use the pipe in your package? The answer is, it depends on your package's scope, aims and goals. Also, this is probably your first package, so it doesn't have to be perfect. If using the pipe helps you get the job done this time around, go for it. Just know that if you aim to ever build a widely used package, you probably do not want to depend on it.

> Note: with the advent of the base R pipe `|>`, you can now use that pipe and no longer have to add it as a dependency!

## Package documentation for R

There are several levels of documentation possible for R packages:
- code-level documentation (Roxygen-style comments)
- vignettes
- package websites (via `pkgdown`)

### Code-level documentation (Roxygen-style comments)

- We learned the basics of how to write Roxygen-style comments in DSCI 511
- In the package context, there are Namespace tags you should know about:
    - `@export` - this should be added to all package functions you want your user to know about
    - `@NoRd` - this should be added to helper/internal helper functions that you don't want your user to know about

### Vignettes
It is common for packages to have vignettes (think demos with narratives) showing how to use the package in a more real-world scenario than the documentation examples show. Think of your vignette as a demonstration of how someone would use your function to solve a problem.

- It should demonstrate how the individual functions in your package work, as well as how they can be integrated together.

- To create a template for your vignette, run:
    ```
    usethis::use_vignette("package_name-vignette")
    ```

- Add content to that file and knit it when done.

As an example, here's the `dplyr` vignette: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html>

### Package websites (via [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/))

- Vignettes are very helpful, however they are not that discoverable by others, websites are a much easier way to share your package with others.

- The `pkgdown` R package let's you build a beautiful website for your R package in 4 steps!

    1. Turn on GitHub pages in your package repository, setting `main branch / docs folder` as the source.

    2. Install `pkgdown`: `install.packages("pkgdown")

    3. Run `pkgdown::build_site()` from the root of your project, and commit and push the changes made by this.

    4. Push your code, including the `docs` directory to GitHub.com


In addition to the beautiful website, `pkgdown` automatically links to your vignette under the articles section of the website!!! 🎉🎉🎉

> Note you can also configure a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the rebuilding of the `pkgdown` site
> anytime changes are pushed to your package's GitHub repository.
> We will discuss this later in the course under the topic of continuous deployment.
