## Continuous Integration (CI)

Defined as the practice of **frequently** integrating code (*e.g.*, several times a day) changes from contributors to a shared repository. Often the submission of code to the shared repository is combined with automated testing (and other things, such as style checking) to increase code dependability and quality.

### Why use CI + automated testing

- detects errors sooner
- reduces the amount of code to be examined when debugging
- facilitates merging
- ensures new code additions do not introduce errors
