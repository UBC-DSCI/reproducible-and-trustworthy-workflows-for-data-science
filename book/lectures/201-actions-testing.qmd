3. Link your R package GitHub repo with [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)

4. Copy the [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/) token for that repo from [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/) and add that as a GitHub Secret named `CODECOV_TOKEN`

5. Add the [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/) badge markdown syntax to your `README.Rmd` and knit to render the `README.md` file.

6. Push your local changes to GitHub and sit back and watch the magic happen âœ¨
