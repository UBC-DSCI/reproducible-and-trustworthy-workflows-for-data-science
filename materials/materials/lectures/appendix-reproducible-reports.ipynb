    "- html\n",
    "- Word\n",
    "- Powerpoint presentation\n",
    "- many more!\n",

    "It is a mix of markdown primarily used for narrative text,\n",

    ">     Adding 3 to 4 gives `r 4 + 3`.\n",
    ">     The value of `x` is currently `r x`.\n",
    ">     ```\n",
    "> - Latex equations can be written the same way as in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    ">   and standard markdown documents.\n",
    ">       - `$\\alpha = 5$` for inline latex and `$$\\alpha = 5$$` for a math block.\n",
    ">       - When hovering over equations,\n",
    ">         R will display the rendered equation in a pop up.\n",
    "> - R Markdown is built upon the Pandoc Markdown engine.\n",
    ">   This is useful to know since the [Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)\n",
    ">   is a great exhaustive resource for looking up anything Markdown related.\n",
    "> - One of the features made available thanks to Pandoc\n",
    ">   is support for citations and bibliographies.\n",
    ">     - Let's cite the R-package by typing `citation()` into the console,\n",
    ">       and copying the BibTex citation into a new document\n",
    ">       that we call `rstudio-demo.bib \n",
    ">       and adding an identifier string (a key) before the first comma,\n",
    ">       e.g. `r-lang`.\n",
    ">     - Include the following field in the YAML metadata\n",
    ">       in the beginning of the document: `bibliography: rstudio-demo.bib`,\n",
    ">       then cite it somewhere in the text by adding `[@r-lang]`.\n",
    ">       The bibliography will be appended to the document,\n",
    ">       so it is advisable to add a heading saying `# References`\n",
    ">       at the very end.\n",
    "> - When working with R Markdown\n",
    ">   (and code in general)\n",
    ">   be careful that you don't copy stylized quotation marks\n",
    ">   because these will not work.\n",
    ">   For example, this will throw an error:\n",
    ">   ```\n",
    ">   a = “This string”\n",
    ">   ```\n",
    ">   \n",
