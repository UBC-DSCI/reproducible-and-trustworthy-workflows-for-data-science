    "Containers are another way to generate (and share!) isolated computational environments. They differ from virtual environments (which we discussed previously) in that they are even more isolated from the computers operating system, as well as they can be used share many other types of software, applications and operating system dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can fully define containers, however, we need to define **virtualization**. Virtualization is a process that allows us to divide the the elements of a single computer into several virtual elements. These elements can include computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources, and even operating system user spaces (e.g., graphical tools, utilities, and programming languages). \n",
    "\n",
    "Containers virtualize operating system user spaces so that they can isolate the processes they contain, as well as control the processes’ access to computer resources (e.g., CPUs, memory and desk space). What this means in practice, is that an operating system user space can be carved up into multiple containers running the same, or different processes, in isolation. Below we show the schematic of a container whose virtual user space contains the:\n",

Virtual machines emulate the functionality an entire computer on a another physical computer. With virtual machine the virtualization occurs at the layer of software that sits between the computer's hardware and the operating system(s). This software is called a hypervisor. For example, on a Mac laptop, you could install a program called [Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run a virtual machine whose operating system was Windows 10, as the screen shot below shows:\n",
