If I repeat writing code within a single script or notebook, on the third try hair starts to stand up on the back of my neck and I am irritated sufficiently to either write a funciton or a loop. The same goes with copying files containing functions that I would like to re-use. The third time that I do this, I am convinced that I will likely want to use this code again on another project and thus I should package it to make my life easier. \n",
