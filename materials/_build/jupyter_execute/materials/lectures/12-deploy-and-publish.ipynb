    "Defined as the practice of automating the deployment of software that has successfully run through your test-suite.\n",

    "For example, upon merging a pull request to master, an automation process builds the Python package and publishes to PyPI without further human intervention. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use CD?\n",
    "\n",
    "- little to no effort in deploying new version of the software allows new features to be rolled out quickly and frequently\n",
    "- also allows for quick implementation and release of bug fixes\n",
    "- deployment can be done by many contributors, not just one or two people with a high level of Software Engineering expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use CD?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps this story is more convincing:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The company, let‚Äôs call them ABC Corp, had 16 instances of the same software, each as a different white label hosted on separate Linux machines in their data center. What I ended up watching (for 3 hours) was how the client remotely connected to each machine individually and did a ‚Äúcapistrano deploy‚Äù. For those unfamiliar, Capistrano is essentially a scripting tool which allows for remote execution of various tasks. The deployment process involved running multiple commands on each machine and then doing manual testing to make sure it worked.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The best part was that this developer and one other were the only two in the whole company who knew how to run the deployment, meaning they were forbidden from going on vacation at the same time. And if one of them was sick, the other had the responsibility all for themselves. This deployment process was done once every two weeks.*\n",
