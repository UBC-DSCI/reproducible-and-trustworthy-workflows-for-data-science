    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the green \"Use this template\" button in [this repository](https://github.com/ttimbers/review-my-pull-request) to obtain a copy of it for yourself (do not fork it).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a remote branch named `pr` (this will use GitHub Actions to create a pull request for you to review in this repository).\n",
    "\n",

Next click on the `star-wars.Rmd` file. Review the file and observe the following problems with the R Markdown report that was submitted via the pull request:\n",
    "  - Reasoning of the sentence on line 15\n",
    "  - Incompatibility with the sentence on line 15 with the code in the code chunk named `table-of-most-accomplished-pilots`\n",
    "  - Incorrect code in code chunk named `table-of-most-accomplished-pilots` (unested `film` instead of `starships`) leads to naming the wrong pilot as the most accomplished pilot on line 19\n",
    "  - Incorrect code in code chunk named `table-of-most-accomplished-pilots` (unested `film` instead of `starships`) leads to the use of the wrong character's picture in the image that is sourced in the code chunk named `top-pilot` (it should be a picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi, you could use this URL for example: <https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ewan-mcgregor-obi-wan-1570898048.jpg>).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add comments and suggested changes using the `+` sign beside the line numbers (the first time you do this will trigger the start of your code review. Need help? See [GitHub's how to on reviewing proposed changes in a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request).\n",
