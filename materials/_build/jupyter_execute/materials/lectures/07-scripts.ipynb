    "### Figures\n",
    "For figures, saving images as `.png` is also a good choice. Although the downstream usage of the figure can sometimes change this recommendation. For a brief but more thorough discussion of this topic, see the [\"Saving the visualization\" chapter](https://datasciencebook.ca/viz.html#saving-the-visualization) from *Data Science: An Introduction* by Timbers, Campbell & Lee (2020).\n",

    "\n",
    "Model objects that are trained/fit in one script, and then need to be used again later in another script can and should be saved as binary files. In R, the format is `.RDS` and we use the functions `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()` to do this. In python, the format is `.pickle` and we use the functions `pickle.dump()` and `pickle.load()` from the `pickle` package.\n",
