So for example, to `apt-get install` we append `--yes` to tell `apt-get` that yes we are happy to install the software we asked it to install, using the amount of disk space required to install it. If we didn't append this, the installation would stall out at this point waiting for our answer to this question. Thus, the full command to Git via `apt-get` looks like:\n",
