Sometimes the `container_image_version_tag` is ommitted, when this happens the most recent container is pulled, and has the version tag `latest`. In data analysis projects we try to avoid using this strategy because Docker is lazy and if you already have the `latest` version on your local host machine, it will not update it when you re-run `docker pull container_user/container_image` even if there is a newer version of the container image on the remote container registry.\n",

Usually the web apps are only exposed to certain directories and you will only be able to access the files in the mounted volume if you mount them to the correct place.

    "If we want to use a graphical user interface (GUI) with our containers, for example to be able to use the computational environment in the container in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio or JupyterLab, then we need to map the correct port from the container to a port on our computer. \n",

In the case of virtual ports, they are really a software-based addressing mechanism that identifies points to connect specific processes or types of network services. When we are discussing ports in the context of containerization, we are referring to virtual ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we use the `-p` flag with `docker run`, specifying the port in the host (your computer) on the left-hand side, and the port on the container/Docker host on the right-hand side of `:`. For example, to run the `rocker/rstudio` container image we would type `-p 8787:8787` to map the ports as shown in the `docker run` command below:\n",

    "```\n",
    "docker run \\\n",
