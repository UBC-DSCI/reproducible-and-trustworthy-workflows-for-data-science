    "Virtual environments let's you have multiple versions of programming languages \n",
    "packages, and other programs on the same computer, while keeping them isolated\n",
    "so they do not create conflicts with each other.\n",
    "In practice virtual environments are used in one or multiple projects.\n",
    "And you might have several virtual environments stored on your laptop,\n",
    "so that you can have a different collection of versions programming languages \n",
    "and their packages for each project, as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most virtual environment tools have a sharing functionality which aids in making\n",
    "data science projects reproducible, \n",
    "as not only is there a record of the computational environment,\n",
    "but that computational environment can be shared to others computer - \n",
    "facilitating the reproduction of results from data and code.\n",
    "This facilitation comes from the fact that programming languages \n",
    "and their packages are not static - they change! \n",
    "There are new features added, bugs are fixed, etc,\n",
    "and this can impact how your code runs! \n",
    "Therefore, for a data science project to be reproducible across time, \n",
    "you need the computational environment in addition to the data and the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other major benefits of using environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If two of your projects on your computer rely on different versions of the same package,\n",
    "  you can install these in different environments.\n",
    "- If you want to play around with a new package,\n",
    "  you don't have to change the packages versions you use for your data analysis project\n",
    "  and risk messing something up \n",
    "  (package version often get upgraded when we install other new packages that share dependencies).\n",
    "- When you develop your own packages,\n",
    "  it is essential to use environments,\n",
    "  since you want to to make sure you know exactly which packages yours depend on,\n",
    "  so that it runs on other systems than your own.\n",

    "`conda` is nice because it can work with both R and Python.\n",
    "Although a downside of `conda` is that it is not as widely adopted in the R community \n",
    "as Python is, and therefore there are less R packages available from it, \n",
    "and less recent versions of those R packages than available directly from the R package index (CRAN).\n",
    "It is true, that you can create a `conda` package for any R package that exists on CRAN, \n",
    "however this takes time and effort and is sometimes non-trivial.\n",

    "you need to install a kernel in the new conda environment\n",
    "in any new environment your create (`ipykernel` for Python\n",

    "in the environment where JupyterLab is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default,\n",
    "JupyterLab only sees the conda environment where it is installed.\n",
    "Since it is quite annoying to install JupyterLab and its extensions separately in each environment,\n",
    "there is a package called `nb_conda_kernels` that makes it possible\n",
    "to have a single installation of JupyterLab access kernels in other conda environments.\n",
    "This package needs to be installed in the conda environment\n",
    "where JupyterLab is installed.\n",
    "For the computer setup for this course, we did that in the `base` environment, \n",
    "so that is where you would need to install `nb_conda_kernels` to make this work.\n",

    "*More details are available in the [nb_conda_kernels README](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels#installation)).*"
